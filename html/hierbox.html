<B>hierbox </B> <I>pathName  </I>?<I>options </I>?  
<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2">Description </A></H2>
The 
<B>hierbox </B> widget that displays a hierarchy of entries, drawn one per line. 
 The hierarchy is a general ordered tree of entries. Each entry  contains 
a list of subentries which in turn can contain their own  lists of subentries. 
 The lists of subentries can be opened (shown) or closed (hidden). Individual 
entries can be selected.  
<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3">Introduction </A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5">Syntax </A></H2>
The <B>hierbox 
</B> command creates a new window (given by the <I>pathName </I> argument) and makes 
it into a hierbox widget.  <BR>
<P>
<CODE> <B>hierbox <I>pathName  </I></B>?<I>option value </I>?... <BR>
 </CODE><P>Additional 
options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the 
option database to configure aspects of the hierbox such as its colors, 
font, text, and relief.  The <B>hierbox </B> command returns its <I>pathName </I> argument. 
 At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named 
<I>pathName </I>, but <I>pathName </I>'s parent must exist. <P>
An entry an icon (image), 
text label, and optionally a data field.    
<!--
 
  
-->
When first created, a new 
hierbox has no elements.  Elements may be added or deleted using widget 
operations described below.   one or more elements may be selected as described 
below.   <P>
When entries are inserted, they are given a name which can used 
to specify them later.   <P>
It is not necessary for all the elements to be 
displayed in the hierbox window at once;  commands described below may 
be used to change the view in the window.  Hierboxes allow scrolling in 
both directions using the standard <B>xScrollCommand </B> and <B>yScrollCommand 
</B> options. They also support scanning, as described below.  
<!--

<H2><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#toc6">Hierbox Indices 
</A></H2>
Many of the operations for hierbox widgets take one or more indices as 
arguments.  The indices refer to individual nodes in the hierarchy. An index 
may take one of several forms: 
<DL>

<DT><I>number </I>   </DT>
<DD>Each entry in the widget has 
a serial number that uniquely identifies it.  The number doesn't indicate 
the location or position an entry (for example, you can't determine the 
order of two entries from their node numbers), but if an entry is moved, 
the node ID will still refer to it.  Node "0" is always the root of the 
hierarchy. </DD>

<DT><B>active </B>  </DT>
<DD>Entry where the mouse pointer is currently located. 
 The label  is drawn using its active colors (see the <B>-activebackground 
</B> and <B>-activeforeground </B> options).  The <B>active </B> index is typically changed 
by moving the mouse pointer over a entry or using the widget's <B>activate 
</B> operation. There can be only one active entry at a time. </DD>

<DT><B>anchor </B>  </DT>
<DD>Indicates 
the anchor point for the selection. The anchor point is set by the <B>selection 
anchor </B> operation. </DD>

<DT><B>focus </B>  </DT>
<DD>Indicates the entry that currently has focus. 
  This entry is displayed with a dashed line around its label.  You can 
change this using the <B>focus </B> operation.   </DD>

<DT><B>root </B>  </DT>
<DD>Indicates the root entry 
which is displayed as the first entry of the  hierbox.  You can also use 
the node "0" to describe the root. </DD>

<DT><B>end </B>  </DT>
<DD>Indicates the last entry which 
is displayed at the bottom of  the hierbox.  This is the last <I>open </I> entry. 
</DD>

<DT><B>up </B>  </DT>
<DD>Entry immediately above the entry that has focus.  If the focus is 
at root, then <B>up </B> is also root. </DD>

<DT><B>down </B>  </DT>
<DD>Entry immediately below the entry 
that has focus.  If the focus is the last entry of the hierbox, then <B>down 
</B> is the same. </DD>

<DT><B>prev </B>  </DT>
<DD>Entry above the entry with focus.  Unlike <I>up </I>, if the 
focus is at root, <I>prev </I> wraps around to the bottom entry currently displayed 
in the widget. </DD>

<DT><B>next </B>  </DT>
<DD>Entry below the entry with focus.  Unlike <I>down </I>, if 
the focus is on the bottom-most entry displayed in the hierbox,  <I>next </I> 
wraps up to the root node. </DD>

<DT><B>parent </B>  </DT>
<DD>Parent of the entry with focus. The 
<I>parent </I> of the root is also the root. </DD>

<DT><B>sibling </B>  </DT>
<DD>Next sibling of the parent. 
 </DD>

<DT><B>view.top </B>  </DT>
<DD>First partially visible entry in the hierbox window. </DD>

<DT><B>view.bottom 
</B>  </DT>
<DD>Last partially visible entry in the hierbox window. </DD>

<DT><I>path </I>   </DT>
<DD>Absolute 
path of an entry.  Path names refer to the node name, not their entry labels. 
Paths don't have to start with a separator (see the <B>-separator </B> configuration 
option), but component names must be separated by the designated separator. 
</DD>

<DT><B>@<I>x<B>,<I>y </I></B></I></B>  </DT>
<DD>Indicates the element that covers the point in the hierbox window 
specified by <I>x </I> and <I>y </I> (in pixel coordinates).  If no element covers that 
point, then the closest element to that point is used. </DD>
</DL>
<P>
 
<H2><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7">Hierbox Operations 
</A></H2>
The <B>hierbox </B> operations have the invoked by specifying the widget's pathname, 
the operation, and any arguments that pertain  to that operation.  The 
general form is:  <P>
 <BR>
<CODE><I>pathName operation  </I>?<I>arg arg ... </I>? <BR>
 </CODE><P> <P>
<I>Operation </I> and the 
<I>arg </I>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following operation 
are available for hierbox widgets: 
<DL>

<DT><I>pathName <B>activate </B></I> <I>index </I>  </DT>
<DD>Sets the 
active entry to the one indicated by <I>index </I>.  The active entry is drawn 
with a black outline around its label and its index may be retrieved with 
the index <B>active </B>. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>cget </B></I> <I>option </I>  </DT>
<DD>Returns the current value of 
the configuration option given by <I>option </I>. <I>Option </I> may have any of the 
values accepted by the <B>configure </B> operation described below. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>close 
 </B></I>?<B>-recurse </B>? <I>index... </I>  </DT>
<DD>Closes the level of each entry specified by <I>index 
</I>.   The Tcl script specified by the <B>-closecommand </B> option is also invoked. 
If the <B>-recurse </B> flag is set, then each subnode is recursively closed also. 
 If the entry is already closed, this command has no effect. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>configure 
</B></I> ?<I>option </I>? ?<I>value option value ... </I>?  </DT>
<DD>Query or modify the configuration options 
of the widget. If no <I>option </I> is specified, returns a list describing all 
of the available options for <I>pathName </I> (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo </B> for information 
on the format of this list).  If <I>option </I> is specified with no <I>value </I>, then 
the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list 
will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if 
no <I>option </I> is specified).  If one or more <I>option-value </I> pairs are specified, 
then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given 
value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty string. <I>Option </I> and 
<I>value </I> are described below:  <blockquote></DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>delete <I>first 
 </I></B></I>?<I>last </I>?  </DT>
<DD>Deletes one or more elements of the hierbox.  <I>First </I> and <I>last 
</I> are indices specifying the first and last elements in the range to delete. 
 If <I>last </I> isn't specified it defaults to <I>first </I>, i.e. a single element is 
deleted. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>entry <I>operation </I></B></I> ?<I>args </I>?  </DT>
<DD>See the  <FONT SIZE=-1><B>ENTRY OPERATIONS </B></FONT>
 
 section. </DD>

<DD>Returns 
the node index of the entry specified by <I>index </I>.  Several forms of indices 
return an index relative to currently active entry (they are describe 
in the section <FONT SIZE=-1><B>HIERBOX INDICES </B></FONT>
  ).  The <B>-at </B> flag lets you get an index 
for some entry other than the active one. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>insert  </B></I>?<B>-at <I>index </I></B>? 
<I>position <I>name... </I></I> ?<I>option value </I>?...  </DT>
<DD>Inserts zero or more new elements in an 
hierarchy list just before the entry given by <I>position </I>.  <I>Position </I> is 
a number indicating where in the list, new elements should be added.  If 
<I>position </I> is <B>end </B>  then the new elements are added to the end of the list. 
 Returns a list containing the indices of the new entries. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>nearest 
<I>x y </I></B></I> ?<I>varName </I>?  </DT>
<DD>Returns the index of the entry closest to the given X-Y 
screen coordinate. The optional argument <I>varName </I> is the name of variable 
which is set to a string over what parts of the entry the coordinate lies. 
 The part names are <I>gadget </I> and <I>select </I>.  If the coordinate is not  directly 
over any entry, then <I>varName </I> will contain the empty string. </DD>

then each subentry is recursively opened too.   </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>scan </B></I> <I>option args 
</I>  </DT>
<DD>This command is used to implement scanning on hierboxes.  It has two 
forms, depending on <I>option </I>:  <blockquote></DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>scan mark <I>x y </I></B></I>  </DT>
<DD>Records <I>x </I> and 
<I>y </I> and the current view in the hierbox window;  used in conjunction with 
later <B>scan dragto </B> commands. Typically this command is associated with 
a mouse button press in the widget.  It returns an empty string. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName 
<B>scan dragto <I>x y </I></B></I>.  </DT>
<DD>This command computes the difference between its <I>x </I> 
and <I>y </I> arguments and the <I>x </I> and <I>y </I> arguments to the last <B>scan mark </B> command 
for the widget. It then adjusts the view by 10 times the difference in 
coordinates.  This command is typically associated with mouse motion events 
in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the list at high speed 
through the window.  The return value is an empty string. </DD>
</DL>

anchor is the end of the selection that is fixed while dragging out a 
selection with the mouse. The index <B>anchor </B> may be used to refer to the 
anchor element. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>selection clear <I>first  </I></B></I>?<I>last </I>?  </DT>
<DD>If any of the 
elements between <I>first </I> and <I>last </I> (inclusive) are selected, they are deselected.

<DL>

<DT><I>pathName <B>xview <I>args </I></B></I>  </DT>
<DD>This command is used to query and change 
the horizontal position of the information in the widget's window.  It can 
take any of the following forms:  <blockquote></DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>xview </B></I>  </DT>
<DD>Returns a list containing 
two elements. Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;  together 
they describe the horizontal span that is visible in the window. For example, 
if the first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the hierbox's 
text is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, 
and 40% of the text is off-screen to the right. These are the same values 
passed to scrollbars via the <B>-xscrollcommand </B> option. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>xview </B></I> <I>index 
</I>  </DT>
<DD>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character position given 
by <I>index </I> is displayed at the left edge of the window. Character positions 
are defined by the width of the character <B>0 </B>. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>xview moveto<I> fraction 
</I></B></I>  </DT>
<DD>Adjusts the view in the window so that <I>fraction </I> of the total width

<DT><I>pathName 
<B>yview <I>?args </I></B></I>?  </DT>
<DD>This command is used to query and change the vertical position 
of the text in the widget's window. It can take any of the following forms: 
 <blockquote></DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>yview </B></I>  </DT>
<DD>Returns a list containing two elements, both of which 
are real fractions between 0 and 1. The first element gives the position 
of the hierbox element at the top of the window, relative to the hierbox 
as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the hierbox, for example). The 
second element gives the position of the hierbox element just after the 
last one in the window, relative to the hierbox as a whole. These are the 
same values passed to scrollbars via the <B>-yscrollcommand </B> option. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName 
<B>yview </B></I> <I>index </I>  </DT>
<DD>Adjusts the view in the window so that the element given 
by <I>index </I> is displayed at the top of the window. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>yview moveto<I> 
fraction </I></B></I>  </DT>
<DD>Adjusts the view in the window so that the element given by 
<I>fraction </I> appears at the top of the window. <I>Fraction </I> is a fraction between 
0 and 1;  0 indicates the first element in the hierbox, 0.33 indicates 
the element one-third the way through the hierbox, and so on. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>yview 
scroll <I>number what </I></B></I>  </DT>
<DD>This command adjusts the view in the window up or 
down according to <I>number </I> and <I>what </I>. <I>Number </I> must be an integer. <I>What </I> must 
be either <B>units </B> or <B>pages </B>. If <I>what </I> is <B>units </B>, the view adjusts up or 
down by <I>number </I> lines;  if it is <B>pages </B> then the view adjusts by <I>number 
</I> screenfuls. If <I>number </I> is negative then earlier elements become visible; 
 if it is positive then later elements become visible. </DD>

<DL>

<DT><I>pathName <B>entry bbox </B></I> <I>index </I>  </DT>
<DD>Returns a list of four numbers describing 
the bounding box of the text in the entry given by <I>index </I>. The first two 
elements of the list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner 
of the screen area covered by the entry (specified in pixels relative 
to the widget) and the last two elements give the width and height of 
the area, in pixels. If no part of the entry given by <I>index </I> is visible 
on the screen then the result is an empty string.  If the element is partially 
visible, the result gives the full area of the element, including any 
parts that are not visible. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>entry cget </B></I> <I>option </I>  </DT>
<DD>Returns the current 
value of the configuration option given by <I>option </I>. <I>Option </I> may have any 
of the values accepted by the <B>configure </B> operation described below. </DD>

<DT><I>pathName 
<B>entry children </B></I> <I>index </I>  ?<I>first </I>? ?<I>last </I>?  </DT>
<DD>Returns the list of nodes of 
the subentries at <I>index </I>.   By default, all subentries listed in <I>index 
</I> are returned.  If  a <I>rst </I> argument is present, then the node index of 
the  subentry at that numeric position is returned.  If both <I>first </I> and 
<I>last </I> arguments are given, then the nodes of the subentries  in that range 
are returned.   </DD>

<DT><I>pathName <B>entry configure </B></I> ?<I>option </I>? ?<I>value option value 
... </I>?  </DT>
<DD>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no <I>option 
</I> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available options 
for <I>pathName </I> (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo </B> for information on the format of 
this list).  If <I>option </I> is specified with no <I>value </I>, then the command returns 
a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to 
the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <I>option </I> is specified). 
 If one or more <I>option-value </I> pairs are specified, then the command modifies 
the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the 
command returns an empty string. <I>Option </I> and <I>value </I> are described below: 
 <blockquote></DD>

<H2><A NAME="sect9" HREF="#toc9">     Default Bindings </A></H2>
<P>

<DL>

<DT>Tk automatically creates 
class bindings for hierboxes that give them  </DT>
<DD>Motif-like behavior.  Much 
of the behavior of a hierbox is determined by its <B>selectMode </B> option, 
which selects one of four ways of dealing with the selection. </DD>
</DL>
<P>
If the selection 
mode is <B>single </B> or <B>browse </B>, at most one element can be selected in the 
hierbox at once. In both modes, clicking button 1 on an element selects 
it and deselects any other selected item. In <B>browse </B> mode it is also possible 
to drag the selection with button 1. <P>
If the selection mode is <B>multiple 
</B> or <B>extended </B>, any number of elements may be selected at once, including 
discontiguous ranges.  In <B>multiple </B> mode, clicking button 1 on an element 
toggles its selection state without affecting any other elements. In <B>extended 
</B> mode, pressing button 1 on an element selects it, deselects everything 
else, and sets the anchor to the element under the mouse;  dragging the 
mouse with button 1 down extends the selection to include all the elements 
between the anchor and the element under the mouse, inclusive. <P>
Most people 
will probably want to use <B>browse </B> mode for single selections and <B>extended 
</B> mode for multiple selections; the other modes appear to be useful only 
in special situations. <P>
In addition to the above behavior, the following 
additional behavior is defined by the default bindings: 
<OL>
<LI>In <B>extended </B> mode, 
the selected range can be adjusted by pressing button 1 with the Shift 
key down:  this modifies the selection to consist of the elements between 
the anchor and the element under the mouse, inclusive. The un-anchored end 
of this new selection can also be dragged with the button down. </LI><LI>In <B>extended 
</B> mode, pressing button 1 with the Control key down starts a toggle operation: 
the anchor is set to the element under the mouse, and its selection state 
is reversed.  The selection state of other elements isn't changed. If the 
mouse is dragged with button 1 down, then the selection state of all elements 
between the anchor and the element under the mouse is set to match that 
of the anchor element;  the selection state of all other elements remains 
what it was before the toggle operation began. </LI><LI>If the mouse leaves the 
hierbox window with button 1 down, the window scrolls away from the mouse, 
making information visible that used to be off-screen on the side of the 
mouse. The scrolling continues until the mouse re-enters the window, the 
button is released, or the end of the hierbox is reached. </LI><LI>Mouse button 
2 may be used for scanning. If it is pressed and dragged over the hierbox, 
the contents of the hierbox drag at high speed in the direction the mouse 
moves. </LI><LI>If the Up or Down key is pressed, the location cursor (active element) 
moves up or down one element. If the selection mode is <B>browse </B> or <B>extended 
</B> then the new active element is also selected and all other elements are 
deselected. In <B>extended </B> mode the new active element becomes the selection 
anchor. </LI><LI>In <B>extended </B> mode, Shift-Up and Shift-Down move the location cursor 
(active element) up or down one element and also extend the selection 
to that element in a fashion similar to dragging with mouse button 1. </LI><LI>The 
Left and Right keys scroll the hierbox view left and right by the width 
of the character <B>0 </B>. Control-Left and Control-Right scroll the hierbox view 
left and right by the width of the window. Control-Prior and Control-Next 
also scroll left and right by the width of the window. </LI><LI>The Prior and Next 
keys scroll the hierbox view up and down by one page (the height of the 
window). </LI><LI>The Home and End keys scroll the hierbox horizontally to the left 
and right edges, respectively. </LI><LI>Control-Home sets the location cursor to 
the the first element in the hierbox, selects that element, and deselects 
everything else in the hierbox. </LI><LI>Control-End sets the location cursor to 
the the last element in the hierbox, selects that element, and deselects 
everything else in the hierbox. </LI><LI>In <B>extended </B> mode, Control-Shift-Home extends 
the selection to the first element in the hierbox and Control-Shift-End 
extends the selection to the last element. </LI><LI>In <B>multiple </B> mode, Control-Shift-Home 
moves the location cursor to the first element in the hierbox and Control-Shift-End 
moves the location cursor to the last element. </LI><LI>The space and Select keys 
make a selection at the location cursor (active element) just as if mouse 
button 1 had been pressed over this element. </LI><LI>In <B>extended </B> mode, Control-Shift-space 
and Shift-Select extend the selection to the active element just as if 
button 1 had been pressed with the Shift key down. </LI><LI>In <B>extended </B> mode, the 
Escape key cancels the most recent selection and restores all the elements 
in the selected range to their previous selection state. </LI><LI>Control-slash selects 
everything in the widget, except in <B>single </B> and <B>browse </B> modes, in which 
case it selects the active element and deselects everything else. </LI><LI>Control-backslash 
deselects everything in the widget, except in <B>browse </B> mode where it has 
no effect. </LI><LI>The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w 
copies the selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a selection.

The behavior of hierboxes can be changed by defining new bindings 
for individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.

If a hierbox is exporting its selection (see <B>exportSelection 
</B> option), then it will observe the standard X11 protocols for handling 
the selection. Hierbox selections are available as type <B>STRING </B>; the value 
of the selection will be the text of the selected elements, with newlines 
separating the elements. <P>
