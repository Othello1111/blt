The following describes how to compile and install the BLT library.

1. Uncompress and untar the distribution file.  

	zcat BLT2.4.tar.gz | tar -xvf - 

   This will create a directory "blt2.4" with the following subdirectories:

     		   blt2.4
      	______________|______________
     	|          |       |        |
      demos   library     man      src
     				    |
     				  shared

2. Run ./configure

   Go into the "blt2.4" directory 

        cd blt2.4

   and run the auto-configuration script "./configure".  Tell where to find 
   the Tcl and Tk header files and libraries with the "--with-tcl" switch.

        ./configure --with-tcl=/util/lang/tcl

       Switches:

       --with-tcl=dir	Top level directory where the Tcl and/or Tk 
     			header files and libraries are installed. Will 
     			search both "$dir/include" and "$dir/lib".

       --with-tk=dir	Top level directory where the Tk header files 
     			and libraries are installed.

       --with-cc=program  Lets you specify the C compiler, such as 
     			  "acc" or "gcc". 

       --prefix=path	By default, the bltwish demo program, the BLT
     			header files, libraries, scripts, and manual
     			pages are installed in "/usr/local/blt".  This 
     			lets you pick another location.

  The configure script creates a header file "src/bltConfig.h". It will also 
  generate new Makefiles from their respective templates (Makefile.in).

        Makefile.in 	        ==> Makefile
        src/Makefile.in	        ==> src/Makefile
        src/shared/Makefile.in	==> src/shared/Makefile
        man/Makefile.in		==> man/Makefile
        library/Makefile.in	==> library/Makefile

3. Compile the libraries and build the demonstration program "bltwish".

        make 

4. Test by running the demos. 

   Go into the demos directory 

        cd demos

   and run the test scripts.

        ./graph

   If your system doesn't support "#!" in shell scripts, then it's

        ../bltwish ./graph


5. Installing BLT

       make install

   The following directories will be created when BLT is installed.  
   By default, the top directory is /usr/local/blt.  
                  
           ___________|__________
           |     |        |     |
          bin  include   lib   man
                          |
                        blt2.4   
                      ____|____
                      |       |
                    demos   dd_protocols

   You can change the top directory by supplying the "--prefix=dir" switch 
   to ./configure.

*6. (Optional) Compiling BLT into your own custom "wish".

   [If your version of "wish" supports dynamic loading of packages
   you can simply add

         package require BLT 

   to the start of your script.]

   Add the following lines to your program's Tcl_AppInit routine in
   tkAppInit.c

        if (Blt_Init(interp) != TCL_OK) {
            return TCL_ERROR;
        }

   then link with libBLT.a.  And that's all there's to it.
     
7. Send bugs reports, suggestions, etc. to

        gah@bell-labs.com and/or ghowlett@fast.net

   Make sure you include BLT and the version number in the subject line.
